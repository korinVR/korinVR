# About me

**Katsuomi Kobayashi**, a.k.a. [korinVR](https://twitter.com/korinVR_en) (he/him) is a technical director and a VR enthusiast. I got an Oculus Rift DK1 in 2013 and started creating VR experiences and exhibiting them at events on my own, and before I knew it, it became my main job. After working on several commercial VR projects, I joined [Hashilus](https://hashilus.com/) in 2016. I was the main programmer of Shibuya VR PARK TOKYO's "[Salomon Carpet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSA5xTqKyQ)," "[VR Attack on Titan THE HUMAN RACE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqcSkKzAL-0)." In December 2019, I joined [XVI Inc.](https://www.xvi.co.jp/en/) and started working on developing "[AniCast Maker](https://anicast-maker.com/en/)" for Oculus Quest (released in April 2021). I am a co-author of "[VR Content Development Guide 2017](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0722Y22FK)" and a speaker at XR Kaigi 2021-2023 and CEDEC 2021-2023. You can read my detailed activities on [my website (in Japanese)](https://framesynthesis.jp/about/).
