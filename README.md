# About me

My name is **Katsuomi Kobayashi**, also known as "[korinVR](https://x.com/korinVR_en)" (he/him). I am a software engineer and technical director specializing in VR. I got an Oculus Rift in 2013 and began creating VR experiences as a hobby, which eventually became my main profession. After working for 7 years on location-based VR entertainment and Meta Quest app development, I founded my own development studio, [FrameSynthesis Inc.](https://framesynthesis.com/) I have been a speaker at Japan's largest XR conference, [XR Kaigi](https://xrkaigi.com/) (2020-2023), and the largest game developer conference in Japan, [CEDEC](https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/) (2021-2023). Additionally, I am one of the organizers of [Godot Meetup Tokyo](https://godot-jp.connpass.com/), a community event for the Godot game engine. I am also a co-author of the "[VR Content Development Guide 2017](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0722Y22FK)."
